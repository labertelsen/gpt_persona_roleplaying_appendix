# gpt_persona_roleplaying_appendix
Appendix for GPT Persona Roleplaying In Early Stage Automation.

Abstract:

This research presents a method of persona creation and implementation through custom Large Language Models. In Case Study 1, we provide ChatGPT4 with a minimal persona description and conduct three trials of two design methods. In Case Study  2, we create custom Generative Pretrained Transformers to roleplay the personas. The GPTs are given intensive roleplay preparation and detailed persona descriptions before carrying out design methods. We find that intensive roleplay preparation yields satisfactory GPT roleplaying, while the design method  implementation is insufficient and requires further research.
